My Python solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of
skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## My Solutions

Use `bash run.sh` to run all solutions at once, or run them individually using the
