My Python solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles for a variety of
skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any preferred programming
language. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training,
university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
