# Advent of Code 2019
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/) written in Python

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of
skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university
coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
